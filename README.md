# GAV-Learn
In this repository we include the datasets that are used in the experiments of the following PODS 2018 paper:

##### Balder ten Cate, Phokion G. Kolaitis, Kun Qian, and Wang-Chiew Tan. [Active Learning of GAV Schema Mappings](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3196959.3196974). PODS 2018.

# Instructions on using the data
The GAV schema mappings and data examples used in the aforementioned paper were generated by [iBench](https://bitbucket.org/ibencher/ibench).  

In the paper, we considered three different types of GAV schema mappings, namely, the SIMPLE, MODERATE, and COMPLEX mappings. For each mapping type, we further considered three different example-generating settings: ALPHA10, ALPHA30, and ALPHA50, where each corresponds to a different sampling rate for the data examples generated by iBench. For each setting, we used iBench to generated 5 random schema mappings together with random examples, and we report the average performance of GAV-Learn over the 4 random schema mappings. More details of generations of schema mappings and data examples can be found in the paper.
